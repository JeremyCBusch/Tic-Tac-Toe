# Tic Tac Toe

This program is a console based tic tac toe game programmed in C++. The program is written for a player to play an algorithm, which currently isn't implemented.

This program was meant to help brush up my skills in C++ syntax and at the same time give an attempt to a machine learnig algorithm.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
